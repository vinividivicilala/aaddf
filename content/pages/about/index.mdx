Hi!

I'm Osama Abdullah from Bangladesh. I'm a Front-end web developer with expertise in building user interfaces. I started learning web development in July 2022 and often collaborate with UI/UX designers to create visually appealing web applications. My focus is on developing client-side web applications and integrating them with server-side components.

`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Git`, `TypeScript`,
`React.js`
